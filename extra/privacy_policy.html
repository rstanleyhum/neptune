            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast&#8217;s website and our apps
                for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.</p>

            <h2>Information we collect</h2>

            <p>When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an optional email address and a password. Email
                addresses are <strong>only</strong> used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you
                initiate, and notifications that you request. We don&#8217;t send promotional emails.</p>

            <p>You may choose <strong>not</strong> to provide an email address and have an anonymous sync account
                instead.</p>

            <p>We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information
                between the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics about which podcasts are
                most popular to help inform our recommendation engine.</p>

            <h3><strong>Technical basics</strong></h3>

            <p>If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We <strong>never</strong> use
                notifications for marketing.</p>

            <p>If you upload files to Overcast, we need to store them until you delete them.</p>

            <p>If you subscribe to a password-protected podcast, we need to store the credentials you provide in order
                to keep it updated.</p>

            <p>We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in. Our server software also
                stores basic technical information, such as your IP address.</p>

            <h3><strong>Twitter accounts</strong></h3>

            <p>If you connect a Twitter account, episodes that you &#8220;recommend&#8221; may appear in Overcast to
                people who follow you on Twitter, identifying you as the recommender.</p>

            <p>Any podcasts you add to Overcast may appear to your Twitter followers in their &#8220;Podcasts You Might
                Like&#8221; section.</p>

            <p>We store a read-only Twitter login token to look up your Twitter username and avatar, and who you
                follow. Overcast cannot post tweets, change your account, or read your private messages. You can revoke
                access to your Twitter account at any time.</p>

            <h3><strong>Ads and analytics</strong></h3>

            <p>Overcast&#8217;s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use
                particular features, to improve the app.</p>

            <p>No personal data is used to target Overcast&#8217;s ads except the categories of podcasts that
                you&#8217;re subscribed to, such as &#8220;Technology&#8221; or &#8220;Business&#8221;. Each ad
                collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total
                subscriptions from the ad.</p>

            <h2>Information usage</h2>

            <p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.</p>

            <p>We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish
                Overcast&#8217;s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such
                as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.</p>

            <p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to
                exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action
                regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our
                rights and property.</p>

            <p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions,
                user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>

            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all
                communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashed</a>,
                not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt">bcrypt</a>).</p>

            <h2>Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h2>

            <p>You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Overcast iOS app.</p>

            <p>Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only
                accessed if needed for disaster recovery.</p>

            <h2>Third-party links and content</h2>

            <p>Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast
                files directly from each podcast&#8217;s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy
                policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

            <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

            <p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your
                personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

            <h2>Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

            <p>We never collect or maintain information at our website/app from those we actually know are under 13,
                and no
                part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

            <h2>Information for European Union Customers</h2>

            <p>By using MD Handbook and providing your information, you authorize us to collect, use, and store your
                information outside of the European Union.</p>

            <h2>International Transfers of Information</h2>

            <p>Information may be processed, stored, and used outside of the country in which you are located. Data
                privacy laws vary across jurisdictions, and different laws may be applicable to your data depending on
                where it is processed, stored, or used.</p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>

            <p>By using our site or apps, you consent to our privacy policy.</p>

            <h2>Contacting Us</h2>

            <p>If you have questions regarding this privacy policy, you may email <a href="mailto:rsh2117@cumc.columbia.edu">R.
                    Stanley Hum, MD</a>.</p>

            <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

            <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page. Summary of changes
                so far:</p>
